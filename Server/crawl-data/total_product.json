The real beauty in React is actually the architectural pattern that handles data in and out of React applications: Flux. With Flux, you’re able to build data-rich applications that engage your users, and scale to meet every demand. It is a key part of the Facebook technology stack that serves billions of users every day.</p>\n<p>This book will start by introducing the Flux pattern and help you get an understanding of what it is and how it works. After this, we’ll build real-world React applications that highlight the power and simplicity of Flux in action. Finally, we look at the landscape of Flux and explore the Alt and Redux libraries that make React and Flux developments easier.</p>\n<p>Filled with fully-worked examples and code-first explanations, by the end of the book, you’ll not only have a rock solid understanding of the architecture, but will be ready to implement Flux architecture in anger.</p>\n<p>What you will learn</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Understand the Flux pattern and how it will impact your React applications</li>\n<li>Build real-world applications that rely on Flux</li>\n<li>Handle asynchronous actions in your application</li>\n<li>Implement immutable stores with Immutable.js</li>\n<li>Replace React.js with alternate View components such as jQuery and Handlebars</li>\n<li>Test and benchmark your Flux architecture using Jest―Facebook’s enhancement of the Jasmine library</li>\n</ul>",

Scala embraces the functional programming style without abandoning the object-oriented paradigm, and it allows you to write programs more concisely than in Java. Because Scala runs on the JVM, it can access any Java library and is interoperable with familiar Java frameworks. Scala also makes it easier to leverage the full power of concurrency.</p>\n<p>Written for experienced Java, C++, or C# programmers who are new to Scala or functional programming,&nbsp;Scala for the Impatient, Second Edition,&nbsp;introduces the key Scala concepts and techniques you need in order to be productive quickly. It is the perfect introduction to the language, particularly for impatient readers who want to learn the fundamentals of Scala so they can start coding quickly. It doesn’t attempt to exhaustively list all the features of the language or make you suffer through long and contrived examples. Instead, carefully crafted examples and hands-on activities guide you through well-defined stages of competency, from basic to expert.</p>\n<p>This revised edition has been thoroughly updated for Scala 2.12 and reflects current Scala usage. It includes added coverage of recent Scala features, including string interpolation, dynamic invocation, implicit classes, and futures. Scala is a big language, but you can use it effectively without knowing all of its details intimately. This title provides precisely the information that you need to get started in compact, easy-to-understand chunks.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Get started quickly with Scala’s interpreter, syntax, tools, and unique idioms</li>\n<li>Master core language features: functions, arrays, maps, tuples, packages, imports, exception handling, and more</li>\n<li>Become familiar with object-oriented programming in Scala: classes, inheritance, and traits</li>\n<li>Use Scala for real-world programming tasks: working with files, regular expressions, and XML</li>\n<li>Work with higher-order functions and the powerful Scala collections library</li>\n<li>Leverage Scala’s powerful pattern matching and case classes</li>\n<li>Create concurrent programs with Scala futures</li>\n<li>Implement domain-specific languages</li>\n<li>Understand the Scala type system</li>\n<li>Apply advanced “power tools,” such as annotations, implicits, and type classes</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Register your product at informit.com/register for convenient access to downloads, updates, and corrections as they become available.</p>",

    "description": "<p>Content Management Servers (CMS) have been around for a very long time, both proprietary and open source ones, but there has not been a standard way of talking to them until recently. The Content Management Interoperability Services (CMIS) standard provides both an application programming interface and a search language (based on SQL-92). Alfresco CMIS implementation is the basis for many existing CMIS applications, and you can use CMIS too to integrate your application with Alfresco.</p>\n<p>Alfresco CMIS is a practical, hands-on guide that provides you with a number of clear step-by-step exercises that will help you take advantage of the real power of CMIS, and give you a good foundation in using it via HTTP/XML, Java, or scripting.It starts off with an introduction to the CMIS standard, in order to update you on the service API, object model, and query language.</p>\n<p>The first part of the book explains how to use the service API with HTTP and XML/JSON; this is done in order to show that any library, system, or tool that can make HTTP calls and parse XML or JSON, is able to talk to a content management server that supports CMIS. Next, you learn to demonstrate how a higher abstraction library can be used to talk to a CMIS server in an easy way, hiding some of the complexities of the API using the OpenCMIS Java library. Since most of the applications that are built today are web applications, the book teaches readers how CMIS can be used from JavaScript and Groovy; enterprise application integration, taking Drupal and Mule as references.</p>\n<p>Finally, you will learn how to talk to Alfresco Cloud service via CMIS!</p>\n<p>Who This Book Is For</p>\n<p>If you are a developer who wants to learn how to build applications that talk to content management servers in a standard way using CMIS, this book is ideal for you. It will be helpful if you have a bit of programming experience, although it is not necessary.</p>\n<p>What You Will Learn</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Add, update, delete, and search for content with increasing efficiency using HTTP and XML/JSON, OpenCMIS , JavaScript, and Groovy</li>\n<li>Feed content directly into a JavaScript widget from a CMIS call JSON response, so you can see how content management servers can be accessed directly via AJAX calls from a web application</li>\n<li>Integrate Drupal with a content management server via CMIS, so Drupal does not have to store documents and images</li>\n<li>Integrate multiple content management systems in a standard way via an enterprise service bus and a CMIS connector</li>\n<li>Handle advanced concepts such as versioning, permissions, and relationships between content items</li>\n<li>Talk to the Alfresco Cloud service via CMIS, so you can make content available outside the company firewall</li>\n</ul>",

Kali Linux is the premier platform for testing and maintaining Windows security. Kali is built on the Debian distribution of Linux and shares the legendary stability of that OS. This lets you focus on using the network penetration, password cracking, forensics tools and not the OS.</p>\n<p>This book has the most advanced tools and techniques to reproduce the methods used by sophisticated hackers to make you an expert in Kali Linux penetration testing. First, you are introduced to Kali’s top ten tools and other useful reporting tools. Then, you will find your way around your target network and determine known vulnerabilities to be able to exploit a system remotely. Next, you will prove that the vulnerabilities you have found are real and exploitable. You will learn to use tools in seven categories of exploitation tools. Further, you perform web access exploits using tools like websploit and more. Security is only as strong as the weakest link in the chain. Passwords are often that weak link. Thus, you learn about password attacks that can be used in concert with other approaches to break into and own a network. Moreover, you come to terms with network sniffing, which helps you understand which users are using services you can exploit, and IP spoofing, which can be used to poison a system’s DNS cache. Once you gain access to a machine or network, maintaining access is important.</p>\n<p>Thus, you not only learn penetrating in the machine you also learn Windows privilege’s escalations. With easy to follow step-by-step instructions and support images, you will be able to quickly pen test your system and network.</p>\n<p>Who This Book Is For</p>\n<p>If you are a working ethical hacker who is looking to expand the offensive skillset with a thorough understanding of Kali Linux, then this is the book for you. Prior knowledge about Linux operating systems and the BASH terminal emulator along with Windows desktop and command line would be highly beneficial.</p>\n<p>What You Will Learn</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Set up Kali Linux for pen testing</li>\n<li>Map and enumerate your Windows network</li>\n<li>Exploit several common Windows network vulnerabilities</li>\n<li>Attack and defeat password schemes on Windows</li>\n<li>Debug and reverse-engineer Windows programs</li>\n<li>Recover lost files, investigate successful hacks and discover hidden data in innocent-looking files</li>\n<li>Catch and hold admin rights on the network, and maintain backdoors on the network after your initial testing is done</li>\n</ul>",

    "description": "<p>This book presents link-layer cooperative frameworks to improve transmission reliability and network throughput of distributed TDMA MAC protocols in vehicular ad hoc networks (VANETs). The main objective of this book is to present link-layer node cooperation schemes to enhance the link-layer performance of vehicular networks, in terms of reliability and system throughput. The authors present approaches proposed for the medium access control (MAC) and node cooperation in VANETs. The authors also cover cooperative ADHOC MAC for point-to-point communication between a pair of source and destination nodes, and cooperative relay broadcasting for broadcast services in this book. The performance of node cooperation frameworks is evaluated via mathematical analysis and computer simulations, in comparison with distributed TDMA MAC protocols without cooperation. The proposed node cooperation frameworks enhance the performance of distributed TDMA MAC and make it more robust to tackle the dynamic networking conditions in VANETs. Furthermore, with cooperation enabled transmission, the performance of distributed TMDA MAC is more suitable to support the wide range of mobile applications and their strict service requirements which is discussed in this book.</p>\n<p>The proposed node cooperation schemes and distributed cooperation decisions can be extended to wireless systems other than distributed TDMA MAC, such as cellular communication, for vehicular communications introduced in this book. This book is useful for researchers from academia and industry, as well as advanced level students interested in vehicular communication networks.&nbsp; It is also useful for professionals and engineers developing applications that use cooperative wireless communication systems.</p>",

Along the way, you’ll learn the scientific approach to devising a sound and scalable design strategy, followed by establishing a basic foundation using various criteria relevant to that type of site. As each chapter progresses, you’ll add new concepts appropriate for the project type.</p>\n<p>Modular web and app design isn’t just for so-called “creatives.” It’s a teachable science with principles that can be replicated in a creative manner. This approach makes the design decision making process for businesses much easier (and easier to live with).

It allows developers to create games that are bigger and more dynamic, giving the games a higher level of replayability. Procedural generation isn’t just one technique, it’s a collection of techniques and approaches that are used together to create dynamic systems and objects. C++ is the industry-standard programming language to write computer games. It’s at the heart of most engines, and is incredibly powerful. SFML is an easy-to-use, cross-platform, and open-source multimedia library. Access to computer hardware is broken into succinct modules, making it a great choice if you want to develop cross-platform games with ease.</p>\n<p>Using C++ and SFML technologies, this book will guide you through the techniques and approaches used to generate content procedurally within game development.</p>\n<p>Throughout the course of this book, we’ll look at examples of these technologies, starting with setting up a roguelike project using the C++ template. We’ll then move on to using RNG with C++ data types and randomly scattering objects within a game map. We will create simple console examples to implement in a real game by creating unique and randomised game items, dynamic sprites, and effects, and procedurally generating game events. Then we will walk you through generating random game maps. At the end, we will have a retrospective look at the project.</p>\n<p>By the end of the book, not only will you have a solid understanding of procedural generation, but you’ll also have a working roguelike game that you will have extended using the examples provided.</p>",

This approach makes configuration complexities manageable.

You’ll find that you don’t need to be a rocket scientist to grasp the concepts explained and apply them to your work—even when the finances are complicated, such as with the ins and outs of taxes, currency conversions, or special general ledger entries such as down payments or bills of exchange.</p>\n<p>Providing an in-depth coverage of both configuration and end user procedures, the book covers most aspects of the SAP FICO certification syllabus—SAP’s view of the module’s key tasks and procedures—including:</p>\n<p>Configuring and using the general ledger and accounts payable and receivable screens<br>\nConfiguring and completing closing procedures, asset accounting, and financial reporting<br>\nConfiguring global settings and enterprise variables<br>\nAccounting for both profit and cost centers<br>\nCreating a house bank<br>\nIntegrating FICO with other SAP modules<br>\nTaking a jargon-free tone and providing an abundance of examples, Andrew Okungbowa provides a clear understanding of configuration techniques and the breadth of functionalities encompassed by SAP FICO.

It allows developers to create games that are bigger and more dynamic, giving the games a higher level of replayability. Procedural generation isn’t just one technique, it’s a collection of techniques and approaches that are used together to create dynamic systems and objects. C++ is the industry-standard programming language to write computer games. It’s at the heart of most engines, and is incredibly powerful. SFML is an easy-to-use, cross-platform, and open-source multimedia library. Access to computer hardware is broken into succinct modules, making it a great choice if you want to develop cross-platform games with ease.</p>\n<p>Using C++ and SFML technologies, this book will guide you through the techniques and approaches used to generate content procedurally within game development.</p>\n<p>Throughout the course of this book, we’ll look at examples of these technologies, starting with setting up a roguelike project using the C++ template. We’ll then move on to using RNG with C++ data types and randomly scattering objects within a game map. We will create simple console examples to implement in a real game by creating unique and randomised game items, dynamic sprites, and effects, and procedurally generating game events. Then we will walk you through generating random game maps. At the end, we will have a retrospective look at the project.</p>\n<p>By the end of the book, not only will you have a solid understanding of procedural generation, but you’ll also have a working roguelike game that you will have extended using the examples provided.</p>",

As surprising as that may sound, it’s the natural result of the world going digital.

This book teaches you the defensive best practices and state-of-the-art tools available to you to repel each kind of threat.</p>\n<p>Personal Cybersecurity addresses the needs of individual users at work and at home. This book covers personal cybersecurity for all modes of personal computing whether on consumer-acquired or company-issued devices: desktop PCs, laptops, mobile devices, smart TVs, WiFi and Bluetooth peripherals, and IoT objects embedded with network-connected sensors. In all these modes, the frequency, intensity, and sophistication of cyberattacks that put individual users at risk are increasing in step with accelerating mutation rates of malware and cybercriminal delivery systems.</p>\n<p>Traditional anti-virus software and personal firewalls no longer suffice to guarantee personal security. Users who neglect to learn and adopt the new ways of protecting themselves in their work and private environments put themselves, their associates, and their companies at risk of inconvenience, violation, reputational damage, data corruption, data theft, system degradation, system destruction, financial harm, and criminal disaster. This book shows what actions to take to limit the harm and recover from the damage.</p>\n<p>Instead of laying down a code of “thou shalt not” rules that admit of too many exceptions and contingencies to be of much practical use, cloud expert Marvin Waschke equips you with the battlefield intelligence, strategic understanding, survival training, and proven tools you need to intelligently assess the security threats in your environment and most effectively secure yourself from attacks. Through instructive examples and scenarios, the author shows you how to adapt and apply best practices to your own particular circumstances, how to automate and routinize your personal cybersecurity, how to recognize security breaches and act swiftly to seal them, and how to recover losses and restore functionality when attacks succeed.</p>\n<p>What You’ll Learn</p>\n<ul>\n<ul>\n<li>Discover how computer security works and what it can protect us from</li>\n<li>See how a typical hacker attack works</li>\n</ul>\n</ul>\n<p>Evaluate computer security threats to the individual user and corporate systems</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Identify the critical vulnerabilities of a computer connected to the Internet</li>\n<li>Manage your computer to reduce vulnerabilities to yourself and your employer</li>\n<li>Discover how the adoption of newer forms of biometric authentication affects you</li>\n<li>Stop your router and other online devices from being co-opted into disruptive denial of service attacks</li>\n</ul>\n<div>Who This Book Is For<p></p>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div>Proficient and technically knowledgeable computer users who are anxious about cybercrime and want to understand the technology behind both attack and defense but do not want to go so far as to become security experts. Some of this audience will be purely home users, but many will be executives, technical managers, developers, and members of IT departments who need to adopt personal practices for their own safety and the protection of corporate systems. Many will want to impart good cybersecurity practices to their colleagues. IT departments tasked with indoctrinating their users with good safety practices may use the book as training material.</div>",
